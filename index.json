In project RIGA it is not only desired to identify single attributes that act as proxy attributes of a given protected attribute, but also combinations of attributes that act as proxy attributes. In the latter case, it is considered that two or more unprotected attributes combined act as proxy attributes, where each one of these attributes individually are not proxy attributes. This raises a challenging combinatorial problem.\nThe goal of project RIGA is the application of logic-based approaches to identify potential proxy attributes (single or combined) in datasets that can lead to discriminatory Machine Learning models. In the identification of proxy attributes, different relations between unprotected and protected attributes are considered, such as equivalence and implication. Moreover, it is considered that a proxy attribute may have a degree of confidence associated. For example, if it is not possible to infer accurately all the values (100%) of a protected attribute from the information of a set of unprotected attributes, but it is possible to infer most of the values (e.g. 90 %), then one may want to consider such set of unprotected attributes as proxy attributes as well.\nMembers In√™s Lynce (PI) Filipe Gouveia (Co-PI) Vasco Manquinho ","date":1678579200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678579200,"objectID":"0285475ba5331ad424d1e55a306c044c","permalink":"https://filipegouveia.github.io/project/riga/","publishdate":"2023-03-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/riga/","section":"project","summary":"Reasoning Over Indirect Discrimination","tags":["Automated Reasoning","Answer Set Programming","Fairness","Bias"],"title":"RIGA","type":"project"},{"authors":["Filipe Gouveia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1631836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631836800,"objectID":"679d05c33bd73b0ce6ee87de6c2c8c65","permalink":"https://filipegouveia.github.io/publication/theses/phd/","publishdate":"2021-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/theses/phd/","section":"publication","summary":"Complex cellular processes can be represented by biological regulatory networks. Computational models of such networks are essential to have a better understanding of the corresponding cellular processes, allowing the reproduction of known behaviours, the testing of hypotheses, and the identification of predictions in silico. However, the construction of these models is still mainly a manual task, and therefore prone to error. Additionally, as new data is acquired, the existing models must be revised. Here, we propose a model revision procedure, capable of providing the set of minimal repairs to render a Boolean logical model of a biological regulatory network consistent with a set of experimental observations. The proposed model revision procedure takes advantage of a logic-based approach to verify whether a model is consistent with a given set of experimental observations. In case of inconsistency, the consistency check procedure implemented using Answer Set Programming (ASP) determines the minimum number of inconsistent nodes of the model and corresponding reason of inconsistency. An algorithm to search for possible sets of repair operations to render an inconsistent model consistent is proposed. In this work, four repair operations are considered: changing a regulatory function; changing a type of interaction; removing a regulator; and adding a regulator. The model revision approach presented here, considers confronting a Boolean logical model with stable state or time-series observations. Moreover, for time-series observations, both synchronous and asynchronous update schemes are considered. The proposed model revision approach is tested on five published well known biological models. Corrupted versions of these models are generated by performing random changes. The corrupted models are confronted with stable state observations, corresponding to the stable states of the original models, using the presented model revision procedure. Moreover, different time-series observations are generated, consistent with the original models, to assess whether the model revision approach is able to revise the corrupted model under time-series observations. The proposed method is able to repair the majority of the corrupted models, considering stable state and time-series observations. Moreover, all the optimal solutions to repair the inconsistent models are produced.","tags":["ModRev","Model Revision","Logical Models","Answer Set Programming"],"title":"Model Revision of Boolean Logical Models of Biological Regulatory Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Filipe Gouveia","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

In doing so, not only the creation of enterprise software is sped up, but also, and more importantly, people with non-programming backgrounds are granted the opportunity to participate in the digitization effort.\nIn the GOLEM project, new software development approaches will be explored, building on what we believe to be the state of the art of rapid and easy enterprise software development: low-code platforms, in particular, the world leading OutSystems development platform. Like all other low-code solutions on the market, even though the OutSystems platform enables great productivity and short development cycles through visual development and deployment automation, it still requires knowledge about programming and software architectures that only experienced software developers have.\nThe GOLEM project aims to enable non-programmers to develop enterprise-grade applications by evolving the OutSystems low-code development model to a new fully integrated and interactive development experience in which programming is automated, based on natural language specifications, examples given by the developer, point and click demonstrations, or sketches.

Ricochet Robots is a board game where the goal is to find the smallest number of moves needed for one robot to move from the initial position to a target position, while taking into account the existing barriers and other robots. Finding a solution to the Ricochet Robots problem is NP-hard. In this work we develop logic-based encodings for the Ricochet Robots problem to feed into Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers. When appropriate, advanced techniques are applied to further boost the performance of a solver.

Proteins are a sequence of amino acids folded into a three-dimensional structure. Each amino acid is formed by an amine group, a carboxyl group and a side-chain. The side-chain is specific for each amino acid and each amino acid can have numerous possible side-chain conformations, called rotamers. A protein has an energy associated and this energy depends on the amino acids and side-chain that form the protein. Predicting the set of amino acids and respective side-chain that minimizes the total energy of a protein is therefore a very important problem, called protein design. In this work we develop a program to solve the protein design problem using Answer Set Programming. Answer Set Programming (ASP) is an approach to declarative solving problems. This work describes the ASP program implemented to solve protein design problems, using the ASP grounder gringo and the ASP solver clasp to search for the answer sets of the program. Two approaches of the protein design problem were considered: one considered that the amino acids of the protein to design are kept fixed; the other considered that the amino acids are not kept fixed and therefore the amino acids and respective side-chains must be determined. In this work were made two implementations in ASP for the protein design problem. One is a simple codification and the other uses a multi-criteria optimization. Moreover, there were implemented three algorithms of dead-end elimination (DEE): Original DEE; Simple Goldstein; and Simple Split.","tags":["Protein Design","Answer Set Programming"],"title":"Protein design using answer set programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://filipegouveia.github.io/teaching/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
