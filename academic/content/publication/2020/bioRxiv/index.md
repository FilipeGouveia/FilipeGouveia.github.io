abstract: "Motivation: Complex cellular processes can be represented by biological regulatory networks. Computational models of such networks have successfully allowed the reprodution of known behaviour and to have a better understanding of the associated cellular processes. However, the construction of these models is still mainly a manual task, and therefore prone to error. Additionally, as new data is acquired, existing models must be revised. Here, we propose a model revision approach of Boolean logical models capable of repairing inconsistent models confronted with time-series observations. Moreover, we account for both synchronous and asynchronous dynamics.

Results: The proposed tool is tested on five well known biological models. Different time-series observations are generated, consistent with these models. Then, the models are corrupted with different random changes. The proposed tool is able to repair the majority of the corrupted models, considering the generated time-series observations. Moreover, all the optimal solutions to repair the models are produced."
