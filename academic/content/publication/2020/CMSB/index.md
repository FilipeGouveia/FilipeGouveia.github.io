abstract: Biological regulatory networks can be represented by computational models, which allow the study and the analysis of biological behaviours, therefore providing a better understanding of a given biological process. However, as new information is acquired, biological models may need to be revised, in order to also account for this new information. Here, we present a model revision tool, capable of repairing inconsistent Boolean biological models. Moreover, the tool is able to confront the models, both with steady state observations, as well as time-series data, considering both synchronous and asynchronous update schemes. The tool was tested with a well-known biological model that was corrupted with different random changes. The presented tool was able to successfully repair the majority of the corrupted models.
