ModRev is a command line tool to revise Boolean logical models of biological regulatory networks.

This tool was developed for *UNIX* and *MacOSX* systems.

**ModRev** is able to repair inconsistent Boolean models under the following:
- Set of stable state observations 
- Set of time-series observations
  - With synchronous update scheme
  - With asynchronous update scheme
