Nothing was left undone, nothing left unsaid.
We knew exactly what we meant to each other, such was our complicity. He used to say that I was his more than friend, his doctor. He knew that I hate being called by my title, but he did it jokingly, but never able to hide the pride in his eyes.
I enjoyed every moment, I did everything I could, I spent every bit of available time in his company.</description><content>&lt;p>A year ago part of me passed away with him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing was left undone, nothing left unsaid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We knew exactly what we meant to each other, such was our complicity.
He used to say that I was his more than friend, his doctor.
He knew that I hate being called by my title, but he did it jokingly, but never able to hide the pride in his eyes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed every moment, I did everything I could, I spent every bit of available time in his company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part of me died with him, but part of him will always live inside me.
An inexplicable exchange.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He was, is, and will be, as long as there are people who remember him, a true example of a human being.
I can only keep him present by following his example, hoping that one day I can be half the person he is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I&amp;rsquo;m sure of, it&amp;rsquo;s that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t regret what was left to be said or done, but rather take advantage of every moment to say and do before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.
I have nothing to regret, nothing was left unsaid, nothing left undone.
I just have to thank the privilege that I have in calling such a wonderful person my &lt;strong>grandfather&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
