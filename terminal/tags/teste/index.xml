I was also a researcher at &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->INESC-ID Lisboa&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automated Reasoning and Software Reliability (ARSR)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> group, during 2016-2023.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I obtained an MSc in Information Systems and Computer Engineering from &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->IST - Universidade de Lisboa&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> in 2012, focussing on intelligent systems, and information technology.
Then, I worked in the private sector for some years, as a software developer. Here, I participated in several projects, developing, for example, geographical information systems web services, and thematic websites.
In 2021, I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->IST - Universidade de Lisboa&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, being approved with distinction.
During my Ph.D., I was awarded with a doctoral grant from &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->. My Ph.D work focused on the application of logic-based approaches and algorithms to revise Boolean logical models of biological regulatory networks.&lt;/p>
