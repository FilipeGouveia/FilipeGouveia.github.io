I have been a Research Associate, during 2023-2024, at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oxford in the Logic and Learning (LOL) group, in the field of Inductive Logic Programming.
I was also a researcher at <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt/" target="_blank">INESC-ID Lisboa</a> in the <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt/research-areas/automated-reasoning-and-software-reliability/" target="_blank">Automated Reasoning and Software Reliability (ARSR)</a> group, during 2016-2023.

I obtained an MSc in Information Systems and Computer Engineering from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/" target="_blank">IST - Universidade de Lisboa</a> in 2012, focussing on intelligent systems, and information technology.
Then, I worked in the private sector for some years, as a software developer. Here, I participated in several projects, developing, for example, geographical information systems web services, and thematic websites.
In 2021, I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/" target="_blank">IST - Universidade de Lisboa</a>, being approved with distinction.
During my Ph.D., I was awarded with a doctoral grant from <a href="https://www.fct.pt/" target="_blank">Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT)</a>. My Ph.D work focused on the application of logic-based approaches and algorithms to revise Boolean logical models of biological regulatory networks.

<!-- My research interests are included in the field of artificial intelligence, such as algorithms for computational logic, constraint solving, and optimization. I also enjoy addressing practical problems with logic-based approaches, namely problems in the biology field. Other research interests include program synthesis, machine learning and natural language processing. -->

From 2017 to 2023, I have been a teaching assistant at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/" target="_blank">IST - Universidade de Lisboa</a>, in the Department of Computer Science, in the courses of Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures, Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms, Natural Language, Algorithms for Computational Logic, and Artificial Intelligence, being awarded IST Excellent Teachers 2018/2019, IST Excellent Teachers 2019/2020, IST Excellent Teachers 2020/2021, and IST Excellent Teachers 2022/2023.
